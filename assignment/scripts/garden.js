// 1 - Create a variable called `plantType` and assign it the value of a plant type (e.g., "Tomato", "Rose", "Lavender")


// 2 - Create a second variable called `plantHeight` and assign it the value of the plant's height in inches (e.g., 12, 24, 36)


// 3 - Create a third variable called `plantLocation` and assign it the value of where the plant is located (e.g., "Backyard", "Balcony", "Indoor")


// 4 - Console log the value of each variable


// 5 - Create a variable named `isOutdoor` and set it to a boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the plant is outdoors


// 6 - Create a variable named `waterFrequency` and set its value to a string describing how often the plant needs watering (e.g., "Daily", "Weekly", "Bi-weekly")


// 7 - Create a variable called `daysSinceLastWatering` and set it to the number of days since the plant was last watered


// 8 - Create a conditional: if `isOutdoor` is true, console log "Remember to check the weather forecast!"


// 9 - Write a conditional that console logs "Water the plant" if the value of `daysSinceLastWatering` is greater than or equal to 2,
// and console logs "Do not water the plant yet" if the value is less than 2.


// 10 - Create a variable called `daysToWater` and set it to 7


// 11 - Create a while loop that logs "Water the plant" while `daysToWater` is greater than 0,
// and decrements `daysToWater` by 1 in each iteration


// 12 - Create a for loop that logs "Check for pests" for each day of the week (i.e., 7 times)
